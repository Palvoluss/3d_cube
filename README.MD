# 3D cube in Vanilla HTML, CSS & JavaScript
## _a not so simple, little, 3d cube_

Nothing much to do here folks! This little exercise born from a call where we've tried to make some 3d with vanilla HTML, CSS and Javascript

- We're going to do the JS part in the next days
- You can fork the project and use as you want
- ✨But if u are a very good develper you'll make a PR improving this project!✨
